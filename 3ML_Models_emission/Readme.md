Project Title: Predictive Analysis of Atmospheric Emissions Using Machine Learning

Description:
This project, titled "Developing Machine Learning Models for Predicting Atmospheric Emissions," focuses on analyzing London's atmospheric emissions using the London Atmospheric Emissions Inventory (LAEI) data from 2013. 
The core objective is to derive insights into emissions patterns and predict future scenarios. The project employs three machine learning models: Linear Regression, Random Forest, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), 
each chosen for their specific strengths in handling large datasets and predicting complex outcomes.

Key features of the project include:

Data preprocessing and cleaning, ensuring integrity and minimizing bias.
Application of Linear Regression for forecasting future emissions, considering factors like population growth and vehicle sales.
Utilization of Random Forest for its robustness against data irregularities and ability to process large datasets with multiple input features.
Implementation of KNN for its effectiveness in classifying data points based on their proximity and similarity.
The project not only demonstrates the application of various machine learning techniques but also addresses the challenges and refinements needed for accurate prediction in the context of environmental data analysis. Through this study, we provide a comprehensive view of the potential impact of vehicle emissions, offering a foundation for policy-making and urban planning initiatives

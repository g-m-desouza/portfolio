# Python Threading and MongoDB Application for Data Processing

## Overview
This project demonstrates the application of Python Threading for efficient data processing and interaction with MongoDB. It includes a detailed analysis of threading concepts, their implementation in Python, and the usage of MongoDB for data storage and retrieval.

## Key Features
- Use of Python Threading for managing I/O tasks and improving program efficiency.
- Integration with MongoDB for handling data queries and storage.
- Comprehensive exploration of thread synchronization and potential issues like deadlock, livelock, and race conditions.
- Development of a client-server model using Python and MongoDB.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository.
2. Ensure Python and MongoDB are installed on your system.
3. Install necessary Python libraries specified in the requirements.

## Running the Application
- Execute the Python scripts to interact with the MongoDB database.
- Utilize the client-server model for data processing and retrieval.

## Dependencies
- Python
- MongoDB
- Any other specific libraries or frameworks used in the project.

# Java Application for Polygon Generation and Analysis

## Overview
This project involves the design and testing of a Java application that dynamically generates and analyzes polygons. The application allows users to input the number of sides, and based on this input, it creates polygons with specific attributes and colors.

## Features
- Interactive GUI for user input and display of generated polygons.
- Algorithms for polygon generation with a focus on the number of sides and color coding (even-sided polygons are yellow, odd-sided are green).
- Error handling and input validation for robust application performance.

## How to Run
- Compile and run the Java files (`NumOfSides.java`, `Shapes.java`, etc.) using a Java IDE or command line.
- Interact with the GUI to create and modify polygon shapes.

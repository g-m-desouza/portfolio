# Client-Server Application Using MySQL and APIs

## Project Overview
This project is a client-server application. It demonstrates the use of MySQL and APIs in a three-tier architecture to manage and process data securely and efficiently.

## Features
- API for data input and SQL stored command execution.
- SQL stored procedures for database operations ensuring data integrity and security.
- Extensive error handling and access restrictions.
- Automated testing with Postman for robust functionality verification.

## Installation and Setup
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install MySQL and set up the database using the provided SQL script.
3. Install Node.js to run the server.
4. Navigate to the project directory and run `npm install` to install dependencies.

## Running the Application
- Start the server using `node server.js`.
- The application can be interacted with via API endpoints, which can be tested using Postman or similar tools.

## Dependencies
- MySQL
- Node.js
- Express.js (for API handling)
